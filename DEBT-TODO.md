# DEBT TODO

## Summary
- Completion context prefixes are centralized and covered by tests.
- Normal-mode key handling is centralized in `KeyHandlingDecider`.
- Grouped list persistence keys are shared between production and tests.
- Token types are now strongly typed with an unknown fallback.

## Open Issues
## Archive (Resolved / No longer reproducible)
### DEBT-0010: Token types are stringly-typed across highlighting and classification
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Introduced `TokenType` enum with unknown fallback and updated classifier/highlighting/tests.
### DEBT-0009: Collapsed-group persistence uses stringly-typed keys across tests
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Added `UserDefaultsKeys` helper and switched production/tests to shared keys.
### DEBT-0008: Keyboard shortcut mappings split across view layers
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Centralized normal-mode key mapping in `KeyHandlingDecider` and added tests.
### DEBT-0007: Duplicated prefix logic in completion context detection
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Consolidated prefix checks into shared helper lists in `CompletionEngine` and expanded context tests.
### DEBT-0006: TaskListView layout constants are hard-coded
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Centralized layout constants in `TaskListView` for padding, spacing, and column widths.
### DEBT-0005: KeyHandlingTextView mixes input handling and rendering without tests
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Extracted key handling decisions into `KeyHandlingDecider` with unit tests for key bindings.
### DEBT-0001: LauncherViewModel is a god object with mixed responsibilities
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Extracted action service, completion engine, toast scheduler, task list coordinator, and navigation coordinator; `LauncherViewModel` now orchestrates these helpers with tests in place.
### DEBT-0004: API client error handling lacks direct tests
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Added URLProtocol-backed tests for base URL override and non-2xx error payload handling.
### DEBT-0003: Hard-coded key codes and timing constants in input handling
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Introduced named key code constants and centralized toast timing constants.
### DEBT-0002: Token classification is duplicated and stringly-typed
- Resolved on: 2025-12-30
- Note: Centralized token type checks in `TokenClassifier` and added tests; highlight and completion paths now share the same classification helpers.
